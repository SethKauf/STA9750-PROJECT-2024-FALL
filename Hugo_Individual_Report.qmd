### MTA System Analysis: Correlations and Visualizations

The MTA (Metropolitan Transportation Authority) operates a vast network of subways, buses, commuter railroads, and other transit services. This analysis explores ridership trends and relationships between these services using correlation analysis and visualizations.

#### **Correlation Analysis**

Ridership metrics are grouped based on correlation strengths: - **High Correlation**: Subway, Metro-North Railroad, Long Island Rail Road, and NYCT Bus, showing similar ridership trends. - **Mid Correlation**: Services like Access-A-Ride, MTA Bus, and Bridges and Tunnels, with moderate connections. - **Low Correlation**: Staten Island Railway, reflecting more localized usage.

#### **Visualizations**

1.  **Time Series Charts**:
    -   Highlight trends for high, mid, and low-correlated services, with recent data emphasized.
2.  **Correlation Matrix**:
    -   Displays pairwise relationships using a color-coded grid to identify ridership patterns.
3.  **Distribution Plots**:
    -   Show the variability and spread of ridership across all services.

## Analysis of MTA Service Usage

This chart shows how different MTA services, like buses, subways, and railroads, are used. Each blue bar represents the number of riders or users, while the orange curve overlays a bell-shaped pattern to show how the data would look if it followed a normal distribution. Some services, like the Subway and MTA Bus, have a wide range of usage, while others, like the Staten Island Railway, show more consistent numbers.

These patterns help us understand how people use each transit service. For example, some services have clear peaks where usage is the highest, while others are more spread out. This information is useful for improving transit planning and ensuring resources are allocated effectively to meet demand.
