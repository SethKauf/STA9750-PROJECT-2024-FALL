    "text": "Introduction\n\nFinal Project : Analysis on MTA Crime Data - Is the MTA NYC Subway overall better, worse, or about the same as they were pre-pandemic?\nWe will be using the following crime data sources from here. For the purpose of this project, we will only be focusing on Arrests for Offenses Described in Administrative Code 14-150(d) Occurring in Transit Jurisdiction limited to MTA Subway within NYC(excluding Staten Island). The data time frame is from 2017-2024 giving a fair frame to compare data from pre-Covid and post-Covid.\nHowever, Precinct sectors do not mean anything because the average person does not know the location behind all the precincts. As a result, I created a file named Precinct Location by locating the area here. I am able to then aggregate the area by boroughs to compare where arrests and complaints are reported.\n\n\n\nData Cleaning\nHere is a snippet of the original data format:\n\n\n\nThe issues:\n\nThere is no date format\nThe crime types are under each Precinct\nI need Transit District and Precinct in their own separate columns\n\nAfter running the following code:\n\n#Python Code to transpose data\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport csv\nimport requests\nimport os\n\nclass Parse:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.code = 0\n        self.district = None \n\n    def parse(self, line, time):\n        if len(line) &lt; 2 or line[0] == '' or 'total' in line[0].lower():\n            return\n        if line[0].split(' ')[0].isdigit():\n            self.code = int(line[0].split(' ')[0])\n            return\n        if 'transit district' in line[0].lower() and line[0].split(' ')[-1].isdigit():\n            self.district = line[0]\n            return\n        if line[1].rstrip('.0').isdigit():\n            if self.district is not None:\n                return [time, self.district, self.code, line[0], line[1]]\n            return [time, '', self.code, line[0], line[1]]\n        return None\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    month = 1\n    year = 2017\n\n    output_file = open('output.csv', 'w', newline='')\n    output_file_writer = csv.writer(output_file)\n    title = ['Date', 'District', 'Precint', 'Name', 'Arrests']\n    # title = ['Date', 'Precint', 'Name', 'Arrests']\n    output_file_writer.writerow(title)\n\n    while not (month == 7 and year == 2024):\n        file_month_year = f\"{month:02}-{year}\"\n        parser = Parse()\n        if not os.path.isfile(file_month_year+'.xlsx'):\n            dls = 'https://www.nyc.gov/assets/nypd/downloads/excel/analysis_and_planning/transit-bus-crime-reports/'+str(year)+'/complaints-in-transit-report-'\n\n            match month, year:\n                case 10, 2022:\n                    dls = dls+'oct-'+str(year)+'.xlsx'\n                case 11, 2022:\n                    dls = dls+'nov-'+str(year)+'.xlsx'\n                case 12, 2022:\n                    dls = dls+'dec-'+str(year)+'.xlsx'\n                case _:\n                    dls = dls+file_month_year+'.xlsx'\n\n            resp = requests.get(dls)\n            with open(file_month_year+'.xlsx', 'wb') as output:\n                output.write(resp.content)\n            output.close()\n            table = pd.read_excel(file_month_year+'.xlsx')\n            table.to_csv(file_month_year+'.csv', index = None, header=True) \n\n        with open(file_month_year+'.csv', mode = 'r') as file:\n            csvFile = csv.reader(file)\n            for line in csvFile:\n                data = parser.parse(line, file_month_year)\n                if data is not None:\n                    output_file_writer.writerow(data)\n        file.close()\n        \n        month+=1\n        if(month &gt; 12):\n            month%=12\n            year+=1\n\n    output_file.close()\n\nHere is a snippet of the altered data format:\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading the Data\nThe following code will load the necessary packages needed to answer the our primary question: Is the MTA NYC Subway overall better, worse, or about the same as they were pre-pandemic. The code will pull up the output csv file created earlier from the python file.\n\n\n\nComplaint Data - Data Wrangling\nSince we are determining data from different time periods it would make sense to categorize by adding in a Period column that aggregates data into “Pre Covid”, “During Covid” or “Post Covid”. In our project Pre Covid will be data from Jan 1st, 2017 to Feb 29th, 2020. During Covid will be data from March 1st, 2020 to June 30th, 2021. Finally, Post Covid will be data from July 1st, 2021 to present time. The code also reformat the date into Month/Day/Year.\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 6\n  Date       District            Precinct Name                 Complaints Period\n  &lt;date&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; \n1 2017-01-01 Transit District 01       14 ASSAULT 3 & RELATED…          4 Pre C…\n2 2017-01-01 Transit District 01       14 FELONY ASSAULT                1 Pre C…\n3 2017-01-01 Transit District 01       14 OFF.

We are able to identify which areas are reeving more complaints and which areas are receiving less complaints. As a result, we can see which areas are over saturated or unsaturated in law enforcement.\nNow that we all the total complaints for each boroughs in different time period, it wouldn’t be fair to judge only by complaints. There are many variables that may affect our primary goal such as false reports and banter complaints. To create a successful metric that determines whether Pre-Covid was safer than Post-Covid we used Arrest to Complaint Ratio. The formula to reach this metric will be:\n\nArrest / Complaints = Arrest-to-Complaint (Very Simple!)\n\nThe above code combines the complaint and arrest data to include borough information. It then calculates the total number of complaints and arrests for each borough during different time periods and organizes the time periods in sequential order: “Pre COVID,” “During COVID,” and “Post COVID.”\n\n\n\nArrest-to-Complaint Ratio by Borough and Period\nFrom the graph, it is clear the Bronx consistently has high arrest-to-complaint rates suggesting stronger enforcement or higher arrest rates relative to complaints during and post-COVID-19.Our findings align with trends discussed in a Biomedcentral article, which reported significant increases in complaints during COVID-19, particularly for assault and harassment. However, our results add granularity by showing how arrest-to-complaint rates varied by borough and over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 10 Precincts by Number of Complaints\nPrecinct 14 and the 5 other precincts ranking in the top 10, suggests Manhattan may be a major hotspot for transit-related incidents. This complements findings from the literature, which noted a decrease in the proportion of arrests in Manhattan after the Subway Safety Plan, suggesting enforcement efforts may have shifted to other boroughs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion for MTA Subway Safety\nIt is clear that MTA subway safety is worse compared to pre-pandemic. Almost every borough, with the exception of Queens has seen an increase in crime rate. We observed a marked dip during early COVID-19, followed by a steady recovery and peak in 2024, indicating intensified enforcement efforts post-pandemic. Our analysis aligns with findings from the Subway Safety Plan, which reported an increase in harassment-related arrests."

    "section": "Revenue Change Over Time",
    "text": "Revenue Change Over Time\nThe MTA’s revenue, which relies heavily on Subway and Bus fares, took a significant hit during the COVID-19 pandemic. As ridership plummeted, the MTA’s monthly fare revenue saw a sharp drop starting in March 2020, as evidenced by the sharp drop in revenue in the graph above . However, as also shown in the graph above, since March 2021 the MTA’s fare revenue has been slowly but steadily recovering. Despite this gradual improvement, we can also see that fare revenue has yet to return to pre-pandemic levels. This slow recovery raises questions about two potential hindering factors: the impact of increased use of for-hire vehicle services and the ongoing trend of “work from home,” which may be limiting the return of daily commuters – and thus fare revenue – to the MTA’s.\n\nHave For Hire Vehicles (FHVs) Affected the MTA’s Fare Revenue?\n\n\n\n\nRideshare Revenue 2017 - 2024\n\n\n\nAs demonstrated by the graph above, before 2020, For-Hire Vehicle (FHV) revenues in New York City were on a rapid, consistent growth trajectory, reflecting an increasing demand for ride-sharing services. However, with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, FHV revenues saw a sharp decline as citywide movement slowed and demand for rides dropped significantly.\nWe can also see that since then, FHV revenues have steadily increased each month since about February 2021, showing signs of recovery. However, this rebound has been slower than the pre-pandemic growth rate, and revenues have yet to return to their pre-pandemic peak.\nAn interesting trend to note is that FHV revenue mirrors similar fluctuations in the MTA’s fare data, suggesting a correlation between the two. While it is unlikely they directly affect one another, the recovery patterns of both sectors appear to be interconnected. When analyzed together, FHV revenues and MTA fare revenue data may better serve as valuable indicators of overall movement and transportation activity within NYC, rather than dependent factors.\n\n\nHow is Remote Work Affecting the MTA’s Fare Revenue?\nWhile hard data on the exact number of NYC workers or the percentage working from home remains unavailable, the MTA has provided literature linking the “work-from-home” trend to subway ridership in 2023, which is a key factor in estimating fare revenue. According to the MTA, the pandemic has significantly shifted ridership dynamics, with discretionary travel—such as leisure trips or non-work-related travel—becoming more common, while traditional commuter travel has declined. One major contributor to this shift is the rise of telecommuting and remote work, which has reduced the frequency of the traditional five-day commute to the office.\nFurthermore, as a result of increasing remote work policies, commuting patterns have changed: ridership is now highest on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, reflecting the reduced need for travel earlier in the week and later in the week. Additionally, weekend subway ridership has shown a stronger recovery, with about 77% of pre-pandemic levels, compared to only 66% on weekdays. These changes highlight how the work-from-home trend has reshaped transit behavior, contributing to a slow and uneven recovery of fare revenue for the MTA, which continues to grapple with shifting commuter habits in the post-pandemic era."

By analyzing ridership trends, we can reveal how different services are interlinked. Subway, Metro-North Railroad (MNR), Long Island Rail Road (LIRR), and NYCT Bus show strong connections, with ridership patterns that closely follow one another. In contrast, Access-A-Ride (AAR), MTA Bus, and Bridges and Tunnels (BT) exhibit moderate correlations, serving specific roles that complement the larger system. Staten Island Railway (SIR), with its more localized ridership, demonstrates weaker links to the other services.\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation of the Subway’s ridership with other systems\n\n\n\nVisual tools, like time series charts, correlation matrices, and distribution plots, make these patterns easy to understand.\n\n\n\nHigh-correlation services are integral to the MTA’s core operations:\n\n\n\nwhile mid- and low-correlation services cater to specialized or localized needs.\n\n\n\nThese insights can help the MTA plan resources better, ensuring the transit system is responsive to the diverse needs of its riders while improving overall efficiency."

    "text": "Accessibility\nThe public transit system in New York City is the biggest form of transportation. However, according to the NYU Wagner publication “Making Transit Accessible for All New Yorkers”, “for roughly 13% of New York City’s population, accessing public transportation poses considerable challenges”. Before the pandemic, the MTA received increasing elevator-related complaints, regarding improper function, needing repairs, or damaged. To explore these pre-COVID concerns, we analyzed the MTA Customer Feedback Data: 2014–2019, filtering the dataset to focus on subway complaints from 2017, 2018, and 2019. I was unable to find a dataset that aligned with my vision for the analysis, so I had to manually clean the complaints data before uploading. Despite this limitation, the stacked bar chart highlighted the ongoing trend of elevator-related complaints across 2017, 2018, and 2019 and accessibility challenges faced by commuters before the pandemic.\n\n\n\n\nElevator Complaints in the Subway System\n\n\n\nDuring the pandemic, a historic agreement in 2020 allocated $5.2 billion from the 2020–2024 Capital Program for subway accessibility upgrades. According to the 2022 MTA press release, “ICYMI: Governor Hochul Announces MTA and Accessibility Advocates Agree on Historic Plan for Expanding Accessibility in the New York City Subway System”, this funding would make 81 stations accessible by 2025, 85 more by 2035, another 90 by 2045, and the final 90 by 2055. To evaluate accessibility progress, we used the NYC Open Data set, “MTA Subway Stations Map”, to create a map of subway lines based on accessibility. For consistency, Staten Island stations were excluded.\n\n\n\n\nSubways with ADA Compliance in NYC excl. Staten Island\n\n\n\nIn this dataset, accessibility is represented as follows:\n\n\n\n\n0: Not accessible\n1: Fully accessible\n2: Partially accessible (usually accessible in only one direction)\n\nOur findings revealed that of the 472 subway stations in New York City, only 138 are fully accessible. This highlights that, despite the MTA’s progress in enhancing accessibility, significant work remains to meet the Capital Programs deadlines."

In examining the factors that might impact these revenues, I identified two key external influences: pre-pandemic, I decided to look at the rise of rideshare companies - such as Uber and Lyft - which were believed to divert passengers away from subway use, and post-pandemic, I analyzed the growing shift to remote work, which significantly reduced ridership on New York City’s subways. Although my team and I initially considered investigating the impact of fare evasion on the MTA’s revenues, we decided against incorporating such an analysis into this report due to time constraints and the complexity that would arise from such a multifaceted topic."

    "text": "TASK 2: Idenitfying Data Sources\nIn identifying data sources for this project, I initially considered using the fare data provided by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), which had been used in Mini Project One. However, I decided against it for two key reasons: first, the data was split into seven separate yearly datasets, making it unwieldy, and second, it lacked the level of detail I needed, particularly regarding the relationship between ridership and fare revenue. Instead, I used a publicly available dataset from the State of New York, which provided monthly MTA financial data from January 2019 onward. This dataset included both revenues and expenditures, broken down by type, allowing me to track monthly trends in revenue and gain a clearer picture of the MTA’s overall financial health, including operating costs and capital expenditures.\nFor the rideshare revenue analysis, I was unable to find direct data on rideshare revenues, so I constructed the dataset by extracting monthly ridership trip data from publicly available City of New York datasets. I then estimated revenue by multiplying the total number of trips by the average fare per ride, derived from pricing information provided by Uber and Lyft (the two largest rideshare companies in NYC), along with the maximum trip distance in New York City (8 miles).\nTo evaluate the impact of remote work on MTA revenues, I encountered challenges in locating consistent data on remote work trends. As a result, I relied on a 2023 study conducted by the MTA, which provided key insights into how shifts in work patterns were affecting subway ridership and, by extension, fare revenue."

The first data that I will import into my project is data from the NYCMTA website containing the agency’s revenues and expenditures for every month since January 2019.\n\n\nCode\n# Link the URL to the CSV file\nurl &lt;- \"https://data.ny.gov/api/views/yg77-3tkj/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD\"\n\n# Read the CSV file into R as a dataframe from the URL\nmtafinancials2019to2024 &lt;- read_csv(url)\n\n\nRows: 308304 Columns: 10\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (6): Scenario, Expense Type, Agency, Type, Subtype, General Ledger\ndbl  (3): Fiscal Year, Financial Plan Year, Amount\ndate (1): Month\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nNow that the data has been imported as a dataframe, it must be cleaned. The raw imported data contains information on both revenues and expenditures; however, I only need information on fare revenues. Furthermore, the raw data also contains different types of revenues; so I will need to filter it for specifically fare revenue in order to conduct my analysis.\n\n\nCode\n# Filter the dataframe for transit data from the NYC Transit division and financial data that is confirmed\nmtafinancials2019to2024 &lt;- mtafinancials2019to2024 |&gt;\n  filter(Agency == \"NYCT\", Scenario == \"Actual\")\n\n# Filter the dataframe for revenue data, then sum the revenue based on month\nmtafarerevenue2019to2024 &lt;- mtafinancials2019to2024 |&gt;\n  filter(Type == \"Total Revenue\", `General Ledger` == \"Farebox Revenue\") |&gt;\n  group_by(Month) |&gt;\n  summarise(Fare_Revenue = sum(Amount, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\nNow that the data has been filtered by revenue type and grouped by month, I will create a plot to visualize the new dataframe. Here, I am interested in identifying if there are any trends one might be able to see in the data.\n\n\nCode\n# Create a plot of the revenue\nggplot(mtafarerevenue2019to2024, aes(x = Month, y = Fare_Revenue)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"blue\", size = 1) +\n  geom_point(color = \"blue\", size = 1) +\n  labs(title = \"MTA Monthly Fare Revenue\",\n       x = \"Month\",\n       y = \"Fare Revenue\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +\n  scale_x_date(date_labels = \"%b %Y\", date_breaks = \"6 months\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first phase of my analysis is now complete, and several key trends are already emerging. First, the MTA’s monthly fare revenue experienced a significant decline during the COVID-19 pandemic, reaching near-record lows. Second, despite nearly five years having passed since the onset of the pandemic and three years since its “official” end, the MTA’s fare revenue has yet to fully recover to pre-pandemic levels. Lastly, I observed noticeable dips in fare revenue during late 2020 and late 2021, which align with the winter seasons and surges in COVID-19 variants and case numbers.\nKeeping these findings in mind, I’ll now move onto the next part of my analysis: examining the revenues of NYC’s two largest rideshare companies by market share; Uber and Lyft."

Additionally, I will need to convert my ridership statistics into a revenue estimate. To do this, I will first multiply the average price per mile for each rideshare company by the average distance traveled by a rideshare customer in NYC. Then, I will multiply this value by the number of trips taken in a given month to calculate the estimated revenue.\n\n\nCode\n# Cleaning the Uber Data for Data from 2017 Onward\nuber_ride_stats2017to2024 &lt;- uber_ride_stats |&gt;\n  filter(year &gt;= 2017) |&gt;\n  select(base_name, year, month, total_dispatched_trips) |&gt;\n  mutate(total_estimated_revenue = total_dispatched_trips * 14.48) |&gt;\n  arrange(year, month)\n\n# Cleaning the Lyft Data for Data from 2017 Onward\nlyft_ride_stats2017to2024 &lt;- lyft_ride_stats |&gt;\n  filter(year &gt;= 2017) |&gt;\n  select(base_name, year, month, total_dispatched_trips) |&gt;\n  mutate(total_estimated_revenue = total_dispatched_trips * 14.56) |&gt;\n  arrange(year, month)\n\n\nAfter cleaning my datasets, I will merge them into a single dataset and combine the “year” and “month” columns into a new column called “date.”\n\n\nCode\n# Combine the Uber and Lyft data\nrideshare_stats2017to2024 &lt;- bind_rows(uber_ride_stats2017to2024, lyft_ride_stats2017to2024)\n# Creating a date column combining the year and month columns\nrideshare_stats2017to2024$date &lt;- make_date(rideshare_stats2017to2024$year, rideshare_stats2017to2024$month, 1)\n\n\nMy dataset is now ready for visualization.

First, it is clear from the data that Uber holds the largest market share in the NYC rideshare market. Second, similar to the MTA, rideshare companies experienced a significant revenue decline during the pandemic, with a sharp drop in revenue at the onset of the crisis, followed by a steady recovery beginning in March 2021. Third, and perhaps most notably, Uber has yet to return to its pre-pandemic revenue levels, while Lyft has surpassed its pre-pandemic revenues. This suggests that, in the post-pandemic period, Lyft may be gaining market share at the expense of Uber.\nBuilding on these findings, as well as my earlier analysis of the MTA’s fare revenue, I will now examine both datasets in relation to one another, exploring their interdependencies or potential independence within the broader context of the analysis."

This suggests that rather than being interdependent, MTA fare revenue and rideshare revenue are likely better understood as reflecting broader patterns in NYC movement and travel. The similar trends in their recoveries — marked by a sluggish rebound — indicate that Uber and Lyft ridership are not significantly impacting MTA revenues. Instead, both modes of transportation appear to be responding to the same external factors, such as changes in mobility preference and consumer behavior following the pandemic."

    "text": "TASK 6: Remote Work in Context\nWhile hard data on the exact number of NYC workers or the percentage working from home remains unavailable, the MTA has provided key insights into how the rise of remote work has influenced subway ridership in 2023; a crucial factor in determining fare revenues. The MTA has found that in the aftermath of the pandemic, a fundamental shift in commuting patterns has emerged, with discretionary travel now more common than traditional daily commutes. Additionally, as telecommuting has become more widespread, the regular five-day commute has significantly declined. As a result, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, now represent the highest commuter traffic days, reflecting this shift in work schedules.\nFurthermore, the recovery of subway ridership post-pandemic has been uneven. While weekday ridership is recovering at a slower pace, at 66% of pre-pandemic levels, weekend ridership has rebounded more strongly, reaching 77% of pre-pandemic levels. This disparity underscores how changes in work habits have altered not just the volume of daily commuters, but also the broader patterns of subway usage - and thus collected fare revenues - across different days of the week."

    "text": "CONCLUSION\nThis analysis highlights the significant challenges and ongoing recovery of the New York City Subway system in the post-pandemic period. Despite nearly five years having passed since the onset of COVID-19, the MTA’s fare revenue has yet to return to pre-pandemic levels, with noticeable dips in late 2020 and 2021 during winter surges in COVID-19 cases. This slow recovery can be partly attributed to a fundamental shift in commuting patterns, with the rise of remote work contributing to the decline of the traditional five-day commute. The MTA’s data reveals that weekdays are experiencing a slower recovery, with commuter ridership at only 66% of pre-pandemic levels, while weekend ridership has fared better, at 77% of pre-pandemic levls.\nFurthermore, the rise of ride-share services — particularly Uber and Lyft — has had a limited impact on MTA revenues. During the pandemic, both companies experienced significant declines in revenue, and post-pandemic, Uber has yet to return to pre-pandemic levels, while Lyft has surpassed its previous revenue figures, indicating a possible shift in market share. Despite these shifts, the revenue trends for both companies closely mirror those of the MTA, suggesting that Uber and Lyft may be better understood as indicators of post-pandemic movement in NYC rather than as direct factors influencing each other’s performance.\nUltimately, it is clear that the rise in telecommuting and subsequent change in commuter habits has been among the most significant factors hindering the MTA’s economic recovery. Moving forward, adapting to this new reality will be crucial for the MTA as it seeks to adjust its strategies to drive up both ridership and revenue."

    "text": "Our team, Metro Mindset, focused on assessing the overall health of the MTA NYC Subway system during its post-pandemic recovery. As part of this effort, my role was to analyze Accessibility, and focus on ADA compliance within the MTA system. My goal was to answer two key questions: (1) Has subway ADA accessibility improved since the pandemic? and (2) Of the accessible subway stations, how many are fully accessible, meaning equipped with all necessary ADA features such as elevators, ramps, tactile guides, etc.?\n\n\nTo evaluate these pre-COVID concerns, I utilized the Data.ny file “MTA Customer Feedback Data: 2014-2019”1. One of my biggest challenges was creating a code to generate a stacked bar chart of the top complaints from 2017, 2018, and 2019. To address this, I cleaned the data file before uploading it.\nThe cleaning process involved filtering the dataset to include only records from 2017, 2018, and 2019. Next, I filtered the ‘Issues’ and ‘Subject Detail’ columns to isolate specific complaints and calculated their counts. I stored the results in separate Excel files labeled by year. I sorted the complaints by count in descending order, keeping only the top 10 complaints for each year. Using the total number of complaints for each year, I calculated the percentage for each issue and added this as a new column.This cleaned and organized data was then used to create a stacked bar chart to visualize the top complaints across 2017, 2018, and 2019.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ncomplaints2017 &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"data/accessibility/2017Complaints.csv\")|&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Count))|&gt;\n  slice_head(n = 10)\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ncomplaints2018 &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"data/accessibility/2018Complaints.csv\")|&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Count))|&gt;\n  slice_head(n = 10)\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ncomplaints2019 &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"data/accessibility/2019Complaints.csv\")|&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Count))|&gt;\n  slice_head(n = 10)\n\n\n\n\nOnce the complaint files were downloaded, I then created a stacked bar chart that breaks down the top complaints by year. With this visual I was able to conclude, from 2017 and 2019 the top complaint regarding subway elevators has been improper function, needing repairs, or damaged. This data is significant because according to the NYU Wagner publication “Making Transit Accessible for All New Yorkers”, “for roughly 13% of New York City’s population, accessing public transportation poses considerable challenges”2. This analysis highlights the growing accessibility challenges faced by commuters before the pandemic. I was next task with gathering information regarding the subway accessibility after the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAfter downloading the complaint files, I used R and the ggplot2 library to make a stacked bar chart showing the top elevator complaints from 2017 to 2019. The chart made it clear that the biggest issue across all three years about elevators were improper function, needing repairs, or damaged. This stood out as a consistent problem.This data is significant because, as the NYU Wagner reports, “for roughly 13% of New York City’s population, accessing public transportation poses considerable challenges.” The data shows that accessibility was already a serious issue for many subway riders even before the pandemic.\nFrom here, I moved on to look at how things changed after COVID-19,

the MTA discussing the 2020–2024 Capital Program. According to the 2022 MTA press release, “ICYMI: Governor Hochul Announces MTA and Accessibility Advocates Agree on Historic Plan for Expanding Accessibility in the New York City Subway System”3, the Capital Program funding will make 81 stations accessible by 2025, 85 more by 2035, another 90 by 2045, and the final 90 by 2055. To validate whether the Capital Program has met its accessibility goals, I created a chart and map showing subway line accessibility, using the Data.ny ‘MTA Subway Stations’4 dataset.\n\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Load the CSV file\nsubwayStations &lt;- read_csv(\"data/accessibility/MTA_Subway_Stations_20241129.csv\")\n\n# Filter out Staten Island and count distinct Station IDs for each ADA value\nada_counts &lt;- subwayStations |&gt;\n  filter(Line != \"Staten Island\") |&gt;\n  distinct(`Station ID`, ADA) |&gt;  # Keep distinct Station ID and ADA pairs\n  group_by(ADA) |&gt;\n  summarize(count = n()) |&gt;\n  arrange(ADA)\n\n# Print the counts\nprint(ada_counts)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n    ADA count\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1     0   325\n2     1   138\n3     2     9\n\n\nIn this dataset, accessibility is represented as follows: 0: Not accessible 1: Fully accessible 2: Partially accessible (usually accessible in only one direction)\nTo go a long with the chart I created a map of NYC subways categorized by their accessibility status: not accessible, fully accessible, and partially accessible. From this, I was able to gather of the 472 NYC subway stations only 138 are fully accessible while 325 still remain not accessible.\n\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(sf)\n\nWarning: package 'sf' was built under R version 4.4.2\n\n\nLinking to GEOS 3.12.2, GDAL 3.9.3, PROJ 9.4.1; sf_use_s2() is TRUE\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readr)\n\nif (!file.exists(\"data/accessibility/nyc_borough_boundaries.zip\")) {\n    download.file(\"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/geospatial/tqmj-j8zm?method=export&format=Shapefile\", \n                  destfile = \"data/accessibility/nyc_borough_boundaries.zip\")\n}\ntd &lt;- tempdir()\nzip_contents &lt;- unzip(\"data/accessibility/nyc_borough_boundaries.zip\", exdir = td)\nfname_shp &lt;- zip_contents[grepl(\"shp$\", zip_contents)]\nnyc_sf &lt;- read_sf(fname_shp)\n\n# Load subway stations data\nsubwayStations &lt;- read_csv(\"data/accessibility/MTA_Subway_Stations_20241129.csv\")\n\nRows: 496 Columns: 19\n\n\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (11): GTFS Stop ID, Division, Line, Stop Name, Borough, Daytime Routes, ...\ndbl  (7): Station ID, Complex ID, GTFS Latitude, GTFS Longitude, ADA, ADA No...\nlgl  (1): CBD\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n# Process the data and create an sf object, filtering out Staten Island\nstations_sf &lt;- subwayStations |&gt;\n  filter(Line != \"Staten Island\") |&gt;  # Exclude Staten Island\n  select(ADA, Latitude = `GTFS Latitude`, Longitude = `GTFS Longitude`) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(Latitude) & !is.na(Longitude)) |&gt;  # Remove rows with missing coordinates\n  mutate(ADA = factor(ADA)) |&gt;  # Convert ADA to factor for discrete mapping\n  st_as_sf(coords = c(\"Longitude\", \"Latitude\"), crs = 4326)\n\n# Create a map of NYC subway stations with ADA compliance\nggplot() + \n  geom_sf(data = nyc_sf, aes(geometry = geometry), fill = NA, color = \"black\") +  # NYC boundaries\n  geom_sf(data = stations_sf, aes(geometry = geometry, color = ADA), size = 0.8, alpha = 0.7) +  # Reduce dot size and add transparency\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"0\" = \"pink\", \"1\" = \"blue\", \"2\" = \"red\"),  # Customize colors for ADA levels\n    labels = c(\"Not Accessible\", \"Partially Accessible\", \"Fully Accessible\"),\n    name = \"ADA Compliance\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"NYC Subway Stations with ADA Compliance (Excluding Staten Island)\",\n    caption = \"Data Source: MTA\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10),  # Center and enlarge title\n    legend.position = \"right\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Adjust the size and aspect ratio of the plot\nggsave(\"images/NYC_Subway_ADA_Map_Excluding_Staten_Island.png\", width = 12, height = 8, dpi = 300)\n\nprint(\"images/NYC_Subway_ADA_Map_Excluding_Staten_Island.png\")\n\n[1] \"images/NYC_Subway_ADA_Map_Excluding_Staten_Island.png\"\n\n\nSince the dataset did not include accessibility data from before or during the pandemic, I used additional information from “Making Transit Accessible for All New Yorkers”\nSince the dataset did not include data on accessibility prior or during the pandemic to help with my analysis of finding out if the Capital Program has been able to keep up with its agreement, I decided to use the NYU Wagner publication “Making Transit Accessible for All New Yorkers”. According to the publication, between 2020 and 2026, only 26 stations have been made accessible.\n\n\n\nOne of the limitations of the dataset is it included Staten Island which my group agreed not to include. Although Staten Island was included I was still able to conclude the Capital Programs goal of completing 81 but 2025 will not be meet unless the pace of the process is accelerated\nConclusion:\nMy analysis revealed that, out of the 472 subway stations in New York City, only 138 are fully accessible. This highlights that, despite the MTA’s progress in improving accessibility, significant work remains to be done."

Some services, like the Subway and MTA Bus, have a wide range of usage, while others, like the Staten Island Railway, show more consistent numbers.\nThese patterns help us understand how people use each transit service. For example, some services have clear peaks where usage is the highest, while others are more spread out.
